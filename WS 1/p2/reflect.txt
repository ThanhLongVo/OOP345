Workshop Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) has provided me with the opportunity to apply theory into practice through managing food orders in a C++ application. The main goal is to deeply understand how to design and implement classes in a real C++ program, command-line arguments, while improving memory management skills and handling strings, such as reading and retrieving data from files, understanding and correctly applying global variables like g_taxrate and g_dailydiscount, implementing logic to get the correct result of the discounted price of a dish is a problem that took me a lot of time to solve when the result didn't match my expectations. In addition, in part 2, I learned more about replacing character arrays with std::string, which helps to automatically manage memory. This exercise reminded me of the OOP244 course and helped me understand more about how the program works.
